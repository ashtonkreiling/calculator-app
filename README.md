## React Scientific Calculator
This is my first React Project, a scientific calculator app. I designed the basic operations and the result bar by following this tutorial by Web Dev Simplified https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgRrrOt0Vr8 and then extended it to include scientific operations and single-operand operations using the Iphone calculator app as inspiration.
